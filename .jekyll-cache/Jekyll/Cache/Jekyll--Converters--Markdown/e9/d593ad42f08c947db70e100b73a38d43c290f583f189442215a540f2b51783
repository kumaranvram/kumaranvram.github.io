I"¡<p>I have been programming since school and this passion has not left me since then. Today is the right time to pen down my thoughts as yesterday (September 13) was regarded as <a href="http://goo.gl/b4mdTy">Programmerâ€™s day</a> and tomorrow (September 15) will be celebrated as the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Engineer%27s_Day#Engineer.27s_Day_in_India">Engineerâ€™s Day</a>, and I am a bit of both.</p>
