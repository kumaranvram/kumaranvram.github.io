I"D<p>Well, this is a fresh start! Welcome to my blog (again)!</p>

<p>This is my first blogging experience with Octopress and I thought that would be a better topic to start this blog with. Earlier my blog was in <a href="http://wordpress.com/">Wordpress</a> and I had no plans of migrating my blog to any other blogging platform. With the crash of the backend MySQL, I lost all of my previous blogs and had to start over again. Then, well, here I am.</p>

<p>Then I came to know about Octopress and I was fascinated by the fact that it is a blogging framework for hackers. It is a static blog generator built in Ruby. The bloggers have to write the blogs in <a href="http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/basics">markdown</a>, static HTML pages are generated from these markdowns; these pages are deployed to the server and rendered then. That is one less headache to worry about! I no longer need a PHP engine to run on the server.</p>

<p>So thus you are now reading this on the Octopress platform and let us hope this keeps me fascinated to write posts more often.</p>
